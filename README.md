# Getting Started with Create React App

## Available Scripts

Here’s how you can tailor this React app setup guide for a gym website:

Getting Started with MyGym Web App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following commands to get your MyGym Web App up and running:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view it.

The page will reload when you make changes, and you may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
This optimizes the build for the best performance, ensuring a smooth and responsive experience for users accessing your gym’s services and workouts.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more details on how to publish your gym’s website.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you want full control over your build tools and configuration (such as customizing the webpack or Babel setup), you can use eject. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all configuration files and dependencies into the project for easier tweaking.

You don’t need to use eject unless you have specific advanced requirements. The default setup works well for most gym websites.

Code Splitting
This section covers how to optimize your app by splitting the code into smaller bundles. You can read more here: Code Splitting.

Analyzing the Bundle Size
Learn how to analyze the size of your gym app’s bundle to optimize performance here: Analyzing the Bundle Size.

npm run build fails to minify
If you face issues with building the app for production, this section covers troubleshooting tips: npm run build fails to minify.
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
